    <h3>Line chart for the Office </h3>
    <div id="container"></div>
    shows the seasons viewer votes <br>
    super ugly because the season is a line itself and it doesn't include the dates, just the year which is why its sharp<br>

    (things I haven't done and will be in the next update)<br>
    *fix left axis
    *add all the days and month to cut down on sharpness of the seasons<br>
    *add different variables like ratings or viewercount or something that isnt viewer vote because that doesn't mean much<br>
