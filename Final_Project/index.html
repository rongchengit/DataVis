    What are the most popular baby names in NYC from 2011-2019?<br>
    According to the Charts the overall top 3 in both categories are Jacob at 1393, Esther at 1312, and Joseph at 1162.<br>
    So what does it mean? Probably nothing, or maybe NYC citizens can't stop themselves from naming their children after <br>
    the hit movie star, teen wolf sensation from Twilight, the evil version of Benjamin Button from Orphan, and the man<br>
    that single handily put NYC on the map with his masterful performance of stealing former presidents George W. Bush's<br>
    wrist watch in front of his secret service in David Blaine.<br>

    So with the common interest in these names having all "coincidentally" being named after celebrities and one person<br>
    in particular and his many characters showing up on the graph, multiple times in a incognito-ish way. The man that<br>
    supposedly died from some cold water, the one oscar winning man in Leonardo Dicaprio that has grabbed NYC by<br>
    the gender neutral name by the neck. Who I am convinced deleted the 2018 due to the popularity of Leonardos being named<br>
