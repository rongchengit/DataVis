    <h3>ScatterPlot for Pokemon Weight and Height</h3>
    <div id="container"> </div>

    Red indicating Height<br>
    Blue indicating Weight<br>
    seeing how they are 1 pokemon with two different pins. it doesn't make sense<br>

    (things I haven't done and will be in the next update)<br>
    *fixing left axis names<br>
    *adding labels to the points<br>
    *scale it down and filter the data so its readable<br>
    *change the data because pokemon height and weight should be conjoined as one plot<br>
